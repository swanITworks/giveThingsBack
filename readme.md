#Project Laboratory no 01 IT School CodersLab

Give Your Stuff Away


** Magda ** - a graduate of UX Coders Lab course - prepared a prototype of the project: ** I will give it back in good hands **.

The goal of the project is to create a place where everyone can give unnecessary items to trusted institutions.

The project will be a ** website ** with a simple form that will make it easier for users to donate items.

Magda conducted many studies and observations on the basis of which she prepared a mock-up of the project. Mockups and all additional information about the project can be found in the next tab.
